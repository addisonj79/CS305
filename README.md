#CS305

Artemis Financial is a financial services company that provides customers with secure investment and financial planning solutions. The client wanted to modernize its operations by strengthening the security of its RESTful web API and protecting sensitive customer and financial data from external threats. The company's main goal was to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in its web-based application to ensure secure communication, data protection, and compliance with industry standards. Something I did well was using automation tools to identify vulnerabilities and understand each vulnerability's impact. It is important to code securely because it helps protect sensitive information, prevents unauthorized access, and reduces the risk of cyberattacks. The most challenging part for me was creating the suppression.xml file to identify false positives. To increase security, I implemented secure communication and strengthened the application’s overall protection. I did that by configuring the HTTPS to encrypt data being transmitted between the client and server. In the future, I would continue to use both automated and manual tools to assess vulnerabilities and determine which mitigation techniques to apply. To ensure the code and software application were both functional and secure, I tested the application after each major change to verify that the original features continued to work as expected. I verified that the system could still handle user requests, process data correctly, and communicate securely after implementing security improvements, including HTTPS and updated dependencies. After refactoring the code, I checked for new vulnerabilities by running the same automated security scan (OWASP) and dependency checks that I used earlier in the project. The OWASP dependency check plugin will be helpful in the future to run vulnerability tests on the program. I would show future employers my vulnerability assessments before and after refactoring to demonstrate the vulnerabilities eliminated by my fixes.
